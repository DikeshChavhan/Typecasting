ðŸ§® Typecasting in Python
ðŸ“˜ Overview

This Jupyter Notebook â€” 2.Typecasting.ipynb â€” covers the concept of typecasting in Python, an essential topic for both beginners and aspiring data scientists. It demonstrates how to convert data from one type to another, ensuring smooth data handling and computation in real-world projects.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

Understand what typecasting is and why itâ€™s important.

Learn implicit and explicit typecasting in Python.

Explore examples and common use cases for numeric, string, and boolean conversions.

Develop a solid foundation for working with mixed data types in data analysis.

ðŸ§  Key Concepts

Data Types in Python â€” int, float, str, bool, complex

Implicit Typecasting â€” automatic conversions handled by Python

Explicit Typecasting â€” using functions like int(), float(), str(), and bool()

Error Handling in Typecasting

ðŸ’» Technologies Used

Language: Python 3

Tools: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

Libraries: Built-in Python functions only

ðŸ“š Learning Outcome

By the end of this notebook, youâ€™ll be able to:

Perform type conversions confidently in Python.

Avoid common pitfalls when handling different data types.

Apply typecasting in real-world data preprocessing tasks.
